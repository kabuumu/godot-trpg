# Godot TRPG - Assets Directory

This directory contains game assets:

- `models/` - 3D unit models (.gltf/.glb)
- `textures/` - Grid tiles, UI elements
- `materials/` - PBR materials for 3D
- `audio/` - Sound effects and music
- `fonts/` - UI fonts

Currently using placeholder capsule meshes for units. Replace with actual 3D models as needed.
